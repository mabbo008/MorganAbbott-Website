        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Morgan Abbott. I am 18 years old and currently a first year student at University of California Riverside majoring in Art Studio. My main goal in life is to travel the world and take breathtaking photos of my journey through life and my adventures. My hobbies include thrift shopping, painting, photography, and taking care of my pet bunny. My friends and family would describe me as shy, funny, caring, respectful, and responsible. 

I was diagnosed with Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy in 2019, during Quarantine. Since I have been diagnosed a lot has changed. Before I was very active but unfortunately due to COVID I lost a lot of my mobility. I have had a hard time comprehending my disability and am often put down by the many things I can't do that others my age can. For example, running, walking long distances, and walking up stairs. Before my disability affects my mobility 100% I have a dream of going to Europe, specifically Italy. I know once my disability takes over my body it will be very difficult to do so seeing as Italy/ Europe is not very disability friendly. In high school I did not tell anyone about my issue. I was too embarrassed and did not want to be treated differently or bullied. But coming into college I have realized that I don't really care what others think anymore. I can't change what I have and I have to accept who I am. At times I do wish I had a normal body that can do all kinds of activities. Although I still have not come to complete terms with who I am, I am learning about myself and my disability more and more everyday. 

 I have not yet had a job as I just graduated high school and am now focusing on my college work. I have done some volunteer work at a senior center where I live. I helped the elderly register to vote! I worked with deaf, mute, and blind people which I was very honored to do. They were so grateful and sweet which opened my eyes and encouraged me to help more people in my community. I would love to work at a small thrift store and get myself more out into the world and expose myself to an environment that I have never experienced before.
